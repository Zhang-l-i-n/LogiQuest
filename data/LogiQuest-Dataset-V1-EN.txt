The brothers get along well. One day, Lin Fang, Wang Yong's classmate, came to visit him. Lin Fang is also a person in a wheelchair. This time he brought Mr. Zhu from the charity organization to discuss with Wang Yong again whether he can donate to a hospital. When Lin Fang and Mr. Zhu entered the door, Wang Yuan took the initiative to receive them and asked them to sit down in the hall downstairs. Wang Yuan used the walkie-talkie to talk to Wang Yong upstairs and asked to take the guests to the studio on the fifth floor. Yong insisted on going downstairs to meet the guests. At this time, we saw that the elevator stopped on the fourth floor and then came down. As soon as the elevator reached the downstairs, the automatic door opened.

When Wang Yong on the fourth floor takes the elevator downstairs, the rubber rope will stretch as the elevator descends. When its length cannot be proportional to the length of the elevator, the rubber rope will break because of its rebound force. Because of this, the short sword would fall like a bow and arrow, stabbing Wang Yong who was sitting in a wheelchair.

It is said that you are capable of opening safes, so can you open them within 10 minutes without using electric drills and gas lamps?\" asked the detective group. \"Does it take 10 minutes for three?\" \"No, 10 minutes for one.\" \"But, what's in this safe?\" \"It's empty.\" \"Ah,...\" \"Actually, this is a new product that a safe manufacturer is going to launch this spring, and plans to launch such a safe.\" The slogan of the advertisement is \"Even the female thief Meigu can't match it\". Just to be cautious, the safe manufacturer specially entrusted me to ask you to test it, and proposed that no matter whether it is successful or not, you must record it with a video camera and send it back to the manufacturer.\" Group Detectives set up the camera tripod. \"There is no safe that I can't open, but what if I open it within 10 minutes?\" \"You can get a considerable reward from the manufacturer. Do it quickly, and I will use this hourglass to time you.\" The group detective said A 10-minute hourglass is placed upside down on top of the safe. Meigu also started to move. She attached the stethoscope to the combination disk of the safe, and slowly dialed the number, so as to find out the combination of the safe through the faint feeling. 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes... the sand in the hourglass is quietly flowing down. \"Miss Mei, it's been 9 minutes, haven't you opened it yet? There's only one minute left.\" \"Don't worry, your fingertips are not familiar with this new type of safe.\" Mei Gu glanced at Sha Hua, concentrating on it On the fingertips, finally find out the password. Because it is a complex combination of 6 digits, it takes a lot of effort. \"Okay, it's open.\" When Gu Mei opened the safe, the sand in the hourglass almost went down. \"It's not bad, it's exactly within 10 minutes. Then open the second one. However, the number is different from the one just now.\" The group detective said turning the hourglass upside down. Meigu also opened the second safe at the specified time.

The detectives of the regiment quickly adjusted the flame of the kerosene stove to a higher level, and moved the stove to the front of the safe. Mei Gu put her hands on the fire and roasted her fingertips. \"How about it, are you ready?\" \"Let's get started.\" As soon as the group detective turned the hourglass upside down, Mei Gu opened the third safe. However, this time all the sand in the hourglass flowed down, and 10 minutes had passed, but the safe had not yet been opened. \"Miss Mei, what happened? Ten minutes have passed.\" \"It's weird, why can't it be opened, but...\" Mei Gu glanced at the hourglass next to the kerosene stove. \"Detective Tuan, didn't you do something wrong with this safe? I must have done something.\" Mei Gu was a little anxious, with beads of sweat on her forehead, but she still focused on opening the lock. After about a minute of touching, she finally opened the safe. In the cabinet was an envelope containing a reward. \"That's weird. It's the same way as the previous two times. How could it be slower this time?\" She tilted her head, wondering. Suddenly, she noticed something, \"I was almost deceived by you, I just opened the safe within the specified time, and the reward should belong to me!\" Wow, I really can't fool you.\" The detective group obediently handed over the reward to Mei Gu.

I had no choice but to agree. He immediately took out a photo from his pocket, which was a very beautiful woman, and he said shyly: \"This is my wife.\" \"Oh, very beautiful!\" I replied, this is a typical old man and young woman wife. \"I'm usually busy with work. She said she wanted to learn painting, so I sent her to Tangzhenshan to learn painting!\" \"Tangzhenshan is today because of my help. I didn't expect her to be ungrateful!\" He said angrily. \"Has your wife ever mentioned it to you?\" \"No, she didn't say anything, so I want to prove the truth.\" \"Where did you learn painting?\" \"The Dihao Building on Zhongxiao East Road, my wife must be there.\" Then , I made a careful investigation of Tang Zhenshan.

I sneaked into his apartment while he was out, and carefully installed the bug. It happened that no one lived in the next room, so I rented it to facilitate wiretapping. Of course, Wu Zhishun paid for all these expenses. During the wiretapping, I realized that there was a person named Song Zheping who often had conflicts with him. It turned out that it was about receiving awards, and it almost caused bloodshed at one point. I made recordings of these conversations. Regarding the conversation between Tang Zhenshan and Jiang Xiaoting, I started to listen carefully, which can prove that they do have an intimate relationship, but Tang Zhenshan didn’t really love her, I had to play the recording to Wu Zhishun, she was furious, I was really worried about him What a stupid thing to do!

So only Song and Jiang are the most suspected, because they don't know that there is someone like me. But judging from the lighter that fell next to the corpse, someone must have intentionally blamed Wu Zhishun! Song didn't know Wu, so he had no chance to steal Wu's lighter, only Wu's wife Jiang could. Because she hated Tang Zhenshan's indiscriminate use of love, and was tired of her elderly husband, she hoped that both of them would disappear from now on.

Two years ago, Miyoko was tempted by a TV director and had an abortion after she became pregnant. I don't know how the blackmailer just got her medical records when she was hospitalized and blackmailed her with photocopies.

Tomoda Koichiro held the receiver tightly and thought for a long time. After he made up his mind, he took out a small medicine bottle from the desk drawer. The bottle contained potassium cyanate, which Tomoda secretly took out last night from the highly poisonous cabinet of the electroplating factory opened by his wife's house. The cap is sealed with cellophane. An accident happened one morning, which made Tomoda fearful and played mahjong all night. On the way back, his car knocked down a middle school student who was delivering newspapers. In the early morning, when the sky was just turning white, but fortunately no one saw him, Yutian left the student who was hit and ran away at full speed. However, I do not know where the blackmailer saw it and took pictures of the scene to blackmail him. Mayumi Kato, an innocent singer, was eating breakfast alone in the kitchen when the phone rang, even though it was late. \"Is the money I told you ready?\" Mayumi shuddered when she heard the man's voice. \"This... um...\" \"Give me the money today.\" \"Where is it?\" \"There is a Guangqiu apartment near Guangqiu Station, please come to room 508 of that apartment \"\"Here...

Anyway, between one and three in the afternoon , you can come anytime, I'll wait.\" The other party threatened and hung up the phone. Mayumi held the receiver and thought for a while, Shinichiyo took out a paper bag wrapped in a handkerchief from the drawer of the cabinet, which contained about half a spoonful of potassium cyanate. It was potassium cyanate left over from the suicide of her literary cousin two years ago. Mayumi has a heart of admiration for this cousin. Full of sadness, she kept the bag of potassium cyanate as a relic. \"As long as you get back the copy, use this pack of medicine to solve the problem at last. It's hard to deal with the blackmail again and again in the future. I don't know if I have the guts...\" The theft in high school made her regretful . During the summer vacation, when she went shopping in a department store, she suddenly became obsessed and stole perfume and cosmetics, only to be discovered and educated. Somehow the blackmailer got his hands on the police records from that time and made copies to blackmail her. On the next day (August 5), the morning magazine published a message: \"Reporter Hiroichi Watanabe died in Room 508, Guangqiu Apartment, XX Street, XX District.\" The deceased was found by the owner of the apartment, Mr. Uesaka Shoji. Mr. Uesaka said that he went on a trip three days ago. During the trip, his friend, who was also the victim, asked him to borrow this room. The cause of death was potassium cyanate poisoning. The time of death was deduced to be between 1:00 and 3:00 pm yesterday. There was unfinished juice in the cup on the table, and the juice was mixed with potassium cyanate. The room was air conditioned and the air conditioner was on and the windows were open for some reason. The room was turned over, so the police believe it was a homicide and have started investigations. That afternoon, from 1:30 to 2:30, there was a power outage around the apartment for about an hour. The truck driver crashed into a power pole and cut the power line due to fatigue driving. After reading this message, Miyoko Asai thought to herself: \"When I came back from the apartment, the elevator just went down to the first floor and the power went out. Thanks to the good timing, if I was a little late, I was locked in the elevator. I was lucky when I was close. After finishing the work smoothly, the man died, so happy.\" Tomoda Koichiro also read the news: \"Huh, it deserves it, this way it will be clean. However, I didn't notice that there was a power outage at the time, and I was afraid of trouble when I met someone, so I didn’t take the elevator, but I went up the stairs, but I met two housewives on the stairs, so I was unlucky. However, I wear sunglasses, so don’t worry, room 508 is not the guy’s house, which is quite unexpected.” Kato Mayumi also read that message several times. \"When I went there, there were two patrol cars parked on the road near the apartment. I thought something happened, and I was a little nervous. It turned out that a truck accident caused a power outage. Fortunately, the power outage was during the day, and it would be bad if the power was out at night. When entering the apartment , those spectators are all staring at me, but I'm wearing makeup, sunglasses and a wig, so don't worry about recognizing my face, but what if the police come to me? .. ...Ah, never mind, there is no evidence that I went to that room...Anyway, the man is dead, and no one will tarnish the reputation of the innocent singer.\" Well, wise reader, with cyanic acid Which of the three was the criminal who poisoned the blackmailer with potassium poisoning?

Because the drifting distance of the small wooden box plus the distance traveled by the boat upstream to catch up with the small wooden box is equal to the distance the boat traveled downstream during the period from 10:30 to 11:45, that is: (v-u) (10: 30-t)+(11:45-t)u=(u+v)(11:45-10:30) Solve this equation and get t=9:15.

From the investigation process, I know that Yan Qinxue secretly observes the activities of the stars and the moon in the star observatory every night in order to better study everything in space. The strong wind and heavy rain never stop. It strengthened Professor Pan's confidence and insisted that Yan Qinxue was killed rather than committed suicide. Professor Pan investigated the students closest to Yan Qinxue, and learned that Yan Qinxue was the son of a wealthy businessman, and he had a half-brother. His father died of illness this summer, and Yan Qinxue planned to use his That legacy, all donated to the Academy of Sciences. However, Yan Qinxue's younger brother thought that his approach was quite stupid. He once threatened Yan Qinxue that if he did not stop his unwise act immediately, he would sue the court and ban Yan Qinxue's inheritance rights. \"The day before this case happened, Yan Qinxue's younger brother sent a small package. Yan Qinxue didn't tell anyone what was in the package. When I came to clean the room yesterday, I didn't see the small package. Maybe, the murderer murdered Yan Qinxue in order to steal the small package.\" The cleaner in the courtyard said the above words to Professor Pan. The elderly Professor Pan closed his eyes at this moment, thinking quietly, and opened his eyes again, looking at the rippling river flowing leisurely. At this time, Professor Pan discussed the truth of the incident with the police. \"This is my conjecture based on the situation. Judging the case based on common sense and observation will not be too far apart. Before the case is made public, can I ask people to salvage the river? Although I have a very good reasoning, but If there is no evidence, no one is willing to bow their heads and plead guilty, and my reasoning is just a hypothesis.\" Who is the murderer of Yan Qinxue? What about Professor Pan's ingenious reasoning?\n", "assistant": "\"Afterwards, I finally found this telescope at the bottom of the river. It was a telescope only forty centimeters long. The small package that Yan Qinxue's younger brother sent must be this telescope! But how could this telescope be related to the murder case? \"Professor Pan looked at the telescope carefully, and said after a while: \"My guess is correct. This telescope can be disassembled at any time. Yan Qinxue's younger brother put a fine poisonous needle in the lens barrel of this telescope. When Yan Qinxue put the telescope on the glasses, he turned the screw in the center of the lens barrel by hand to adjust the lens focus. Yan Qinxue panicked and threw the binoculars out of his hand. The binoculars fell into the river below the tower just like that. Although Yan Qinxue pulled out the poisonous needle in the eye in time, it was faster his death.\"\n", "thought": "This is a logical reasoning question that requires analysis and reasoning to find the answer.", "title": "", "command": "", "plugin": ""}

One is a murder case, a member of the House of Commons living on the 4th floor was shot dead with a pistol; the other is a theft case, 6 oil paintings from the 16th century collected by a famous painting collector living on the second floor were stolen; Rape, a beautiful ballerina living on the ground floor was raped by thugs. After calling the police, Scotland Yard (that is, London Police Headquarters) immediately dispatched a large number of criminal police to the scene of the crime. Based on the fingerprints, footprints, and traces of struggle left by the criminals at the scene, the police concluded that the three criminals had committed the crimes separately (it was later confirmed that this judgment was correct). After several months of investigation, a large amount of conclusive evidence was finally collected, and three criminals A, B, and C were arrested. During the interrogation, the confessions of the three criminals were as follows: A confessed: 1. C was a murderer, and he killed the members of the House of Commons purely to avenge his past personal revenge. 2. Since I was arrested, of course I have to make up a statement, so I am not a very honest person. 3. B is a rapist because B is possessive of beautiful women. B confessed: 1. A is a famous thief. I firmly believe that he was the one who stole the oil painting that night. 2. A never tells the truth. 3. C is a rapist. C confessed: 1. The theft was not done by B. 2. A is a murderer. 3. In short, I confess that I did commit crimes in this apartment that night. Among the three criminals, one of the confessions was all the truth, one was the most dishonest, and all he said were lies, and the other's confession contained both truth and lies. Which case A, B, and C did respectively, after reading the confession, Interpol Henry has already made a judgment. do you know?\n", "assistant": "Henry said that this case can be started by analyzing the statements of A, B, and C. It is better to start with A's confession. A said: \"Since I have been arrested, of course I have to make up a statement, so I am not a very honest person.\" Analyzing this sentence, it can be inferred that A's statement is true or false. Because, if A's statement is all true, then he will not say that he made up the statement; if A's statement is all false, then he will not say that he is not very honest. Since A's statement is either true or false, then B's statement is either completely true or completely false. And B said: \"A never tells the truth.\" From this, it can be seen that this sentence of B is false, and it can be judged that what B said cannot be completely true, but completely false. Since B's statement is all false, then C's statement is all true. And C said that A was the criminal who killed the member of the House of Commons, B was not the perpetrator of the theft, so B is the rapist, and the criminal who stole the oil painting can only be C himself.\n", "thought": "This is a logical reasoning question that requires analysis and reasoning to find the answer.", "title": "", "command": "", "plugin": ""}

After country G got the information, it immediately dispatched a submarine to search for it. From this sunken ship, divers from country G salvaged the bodies of many victims, and one of them could be identified as a lieutenant from the military uniform. On the chest of the corpse was a lead box containing top-secret documents. Open the lead box and find 3 cipher books - one is the strategic cipher used by the navy of country Q; the other is the tactical cipher used by the navy of country Q; the other is the commercial cipher of country Q. This discovery makes G country ecstatic. Therefore, they immediately organized a cryptanalysis organization directly under the Navy Headquarters, which was presided over by Rear Admiral Reginald Hall, the director of G's Naval Intelligence Bureau, code-named \"04 Post Office\". This cryptanalysis organization has gathered dozens of authoritative linguists, mathematicians and computer technology experts. After several months of intense work, most of the codes were finally deciphered. Relying on these three codebooks, country G has continuously intercepted a lot of valuable information, including the battle order and firepower distribution of country Q's fleets on various oceans, and the activities of country Q's spies dispatched around the world. As for all of this, Country Q has been kept in the dark, and they continue to use these codes. The following is a set of passwords intercepted by country G: \"101 100 102 210 001 112\". This is a piece of information sent to the country's intelligence headquarters by the spies stationed in country E by country Q. The content of this information is one of the following three: \"Hope to return\", \"Send money\", \"Buy books\". What is particularly interesting is that this set of passwords uses the rules of Chinese Pinyin, and this set of passwords uses the ternary system.

Attachment: Comparison table of ternary system and decimal system\n", "assistant": "The meaning of this group of passwords is: send money.

Replace these three groups of Chinese pinyin letters with Arabic numerals, which are \"16, 1, 14, 7, 21, 9\", \"13, 1, 9, 19, 8, 21\", \"10, 9, 11, 21, 1, 14\".

There is an international tourist ship moored at the pier, which is about to set sail. As soon as the two got on the gangway, two second-class sailors in uniform were waiting there, receiving Anna with a smile. Her husband, Richard, seems to have been on this sightseeing boat several times and is quite familiar with the situation inside the boat. He separated the mixed passengers and led Anna to a cabin marked \"B13\", and the two finally settled down. \"Anna, if you bring any valuables, it's better to store them with the chief purser for safety.\" \"Bring $20,000, this is all my property.\" Anna handed over the huge sum of money to her husband and asked him to send it to the chief of affairs. Save there for a long time. However, after waiting and waiting, my husband did not come back. The whistle sounded, and the boat was out of the dock. Anna went to the deck to look for her husband, but she couldn't find her. She thought maybe she had strayed off, so she came back again, but got lost in the ship, and she couldn't find cabin B13 no matter what. She was at a loss, so she had to ask the passing waiter. \"Room B13? There is no such unlucky cabin number.\" The waiter replied with a surprised expression on his face. \"But my husband did book cabin B13 under the names of Richard and his wife. We just put our luggage in that cabin.\" Anna said. She asked the waiter to check the passenger register for her, but the room reservation was made under Anna's old name, \"No. B16\", and, at some point, her luggage alone had been moved to that cabin. Richard's name was not on the register. The purser also said that he did not remember anyone depositing $20,000. \"Where did my husband go?\" Anna was at a loss. She found the crew members who greeted her with smiles on the gangway when she boarded the ship. Anna thought that they would probably remember her husband, so she asked them.

In order to defraud Anna of 20,000 U.S. dollars, he used a false name, concealed the identity of the crew, and married her in a flash. On the pier, when he went up the gangway with Anna, he wore civilian clothes, of course, so as not to reveal his identity. The second-class sailor thought that the first-class sailor who had gone ashore had returned, and he would never have thought that he was Anna's bridegroom. So when Anna asked them, she said something like that. If it is a first-class sailor on the ship, it is also possible to change the room by pasting a false number on the door of the cabin.

The windows were closed and the curtains were drawn. There was a bullet hole in the curtain and glass, and the time of death was estimated to be around 9 o'clock last night. Zhao, the head of the investigation section, and Xiao Wang, his assistant, were ordered to arrive and looked around the room.

The reasoning can be carried out by using four planes to fly 1/4 of a plane, then the original plane flies 1/4 to 3/4 of the distance, 0 to 1/4 and 3/4 to 4/4 are refueled by tankers Supply is to give 1/2 of the oil, and the original aircraft can fly 1/4, so the two aspects of following and meeting require the oil supply machine to give half of the oil to the original aircraft at 1/4, and the oil supply machine at 1/4 Four planes are required to supply fuel to fly back after the 4 disposals, so in summary (1+4)×2=10.\n", "thought": "This is a logical reasoning question that requires analysis and reasoning to find the answer.", "title": "", "command": "", "plugin": ""}

Because the glass is very thick, the three prisoners can only see each other and cannot hear what the other party is saying. One day, the king ordered his servants to put a hat on each of them, telling them that the hats were only red and black, but not letting them know what color the hats they were wearing were. On this occasion, the king pronounced two orders as follows:\n1. Any prisoner who can see that the other two prisoners are wearing red hats can release him;\n2. Any prisoner who knows that he is wearing a black hat can also be released.\nIn fact, all three of them wore black hats. It's just that they couldn't see their own because they were tied up.

Therefore, it can be proved that there are no 2 red hats among the 3 hats, and it can also be said that there may be 2 blacks and 1 red among the three people, or 3 blacks. So there are two situations: Suppose A is wearing a red hat, so he sees 2 black hats. Both B and C can see 1 black and 1 red. But since the red one is on A's head, then both B and C are black. Then B and C can be sure that they are wearing black hats. So it is impossible for A to wear a red hat. Therefore, A presumes that what he is wearing on his head must be a black hat. Because only when there are 3 black hats, no one can be sure whether the red hat is on his head.

It is not difficult to find through observation that only the two groups of dates, June 7 and December 2, have unique numbers of days. It can be seen from this that if Xiaohong knows that N is 7 or 2, then she must know when the teacher's birthday is.\nAgain, let's analyze what Xiao Liu said. Xiao Liu said: \"If I don't know, Xiaohong will\nI don’t know for sure”, and the months of the 10 groups of dates are 3, 6, 9, and 12, and there are more than two groups of dates in the corresponding months, so it is impossible for Xiao Liu to know the teacher’s birthday after learning about M.\nAfter further analysis, Xiao Liu said: \"If I don't know, Xiaohong definitely doesn't know either.\" From conclusion 2, we can know that Xiaohong will never know after learning about N.\nThen, combining the analysis of 1 and 3, it can be deduced that all the dates in June and December are not the teacher’s birthday, because if Xiao Liu knows that M is 6, and if Xiao Hong’s N=7, then Xiao Hong will know teacher's birthday.\nIn the same way, if Xiao Liu's M=12, and Xiao Hong's N=2, then Xiao Hong can also know the teacher's birthday. That is: M is not equal to 6 and 9. Now there are only five sets of dates left: \"March 4, March 5, March 8, September 1, September 5\".

So there is \"Xiaohong said: I didn't know it at first, but now I know it.\" Through such reasoning, there are finally three birthdays \"March 4th, March 8th, and September 1st\".\nAnalyzing \"Xiao Liu said: Oh, then I also know\", it shows that M=9, N=1, (N=5 has been excluded, there are two groups in March).

Xiao Liu said: \"If I don't know, Xiaohong certainly doesn't know.\" The months of the 10 groups of dates are 3, 6, 9, 12, and the corresponding There are more than two sets of dates for the month, so it is impossible for Xiao Liu to know the teacher's birthday after learning about M.\nAfter further analysis, Xiao Liu said: \"If I don't know, Xiaohong definitely doesn't know either.\" From conclusion 2, we can know that Xiaohong will never know after learning about N.\nThen, combining the analysis of 1 and 3, it can be deduced that all the dates in June and December are not the teacher’s birthday, because if Xiao Liu knows that M is 6, and if Xiao Hong’s N=7, then Xiao Hong will know teacher's birthday.\nIn the same way, if Xiao Liu's M=12, and Xiao Hong's N=2, then Xiao Hong can also know the teacher's birthday. That is: M is not equal to 6 and 9. Now there are only five sets of dates left: \"March 4, March 5, March 8, September 1, September 5\". And Xiaohong knows, so N is not equal to 5 (there are March 5th and September 5th), at this time, Xiaohong's N∈(1, 4, 8) Note: Although there are three possibilities for N at this time, but For Xiaohong, as long as she knows one of them, she can draw a conclusion. So there is \"Xiaohong said: I didn't know it at first, but now I know it.\" Through such reasoning, there are finally three birthdays \"March 4th, March 8th, and September 1st\".\nAnalyzing \"Xiao Liu said: Oh, then I also know\", it shows that M=9, N=1, (N=5 has been excluded, there are two groups in March). So the correct answer should be September 1st.\n", "thought": "This is a logical reasoning question that requires analysis and reasoning to find the answer.", "title": "", "command": "", "plugin": ""}

Answer: No, ask the second one, no, the third one, no, ask the first one again, no, the second one, no, the third one: I guessed it, it is 144! The professor smiled with satisfaction. Can you guess the number of the other two?\n", "assistant": "After the first round, it means that any two numbers are different. In the second round, the first two people did not guess it, which means that no number is twice the other number. Now there are the following conditions: 1. Each number is greater than 02. Pairs are not equal 3. Any number is not twice the other number. Each number may be the sum or difference of the other two. If the third person can guess 144, one of the possibilities must be ruled out based on the previous three conditions. Assumption: It is the difference between two numbers, namely x-y=144. At this time, 1(x, y>0) and 2(x!=y) are both satisfied, so negating x+y must make 3 unsatisfactory, that is, x+y=2y, x=y is solved, which is not true (otherwise the first round would be can be guessed), so it is not the difference between two numbers. It is therefore the sum of the two numbers, ie x+y=144. In the same way, at this time, both 1 and 2 are satisfied, and 3 must be dissatisfied, that is, x-y=2y. If the two equations are combined, x=108 and y=36 can be obtained.\nThe order of these two rounds of guessing is actually as follows: the first round (number one, number two), the second round (number three, number one, number two). In this way, the information obtained by everyone at the end of each round is the same (ie the previous three conditions).\nThen suppose we are C, let’s see how C made it: what C sees is 36 of A and 108 of B, because of the condition, the sum of the two numbers is the third, then he is either 72 or 144 (I guess this is because of 72, 108 is the sum of 36 and 72, and 144 is the sum of 108 and 36.

The following is what C thinks if B is 36: In this case, what C sees is A’s 36 and B's 36, then he can guess himself, it is 72 or 0 (this will not be explained):\nIf you assume that you (C) have 0 on your head, then A can see it in the first round.

(Then reverse and reverse), now A did not report his own 36 in the first round, C (in B's imagination) can know that his head is not 0, if the other is the same as B's idea (referring to B's head is 36), then C can report his own 72 in the first round. Now C did not report his own 36 in the first round, B (in C's imagination) can know that his head is not 36, if the other is the same as C's idea (referring to C's head is 72), then B in the first round You can report your own 108 in the second round.

Thus, if it takes them 1 minute to catch 1 mouse, the same 3 cats will catch 100 mice in 100 minutes. Unfortunately, the problem is not that simple. An assumption is made in this answer, which is undoubtedly not mentioned in the title. This assumption assumes that the 3 cats focus all their attention on the same mouse until they catch it within 1 minute, and then jointly turn their attention to another mouse. However, assuming another approach, each cat hunts down a mouse and spends 3 minutes each catching them. According to this assumption, it still takes 3 minutes for 3 cats to catch 3 mice. So, it took them 6 minutes to catch 6 mice, 9 minutes to catch 9 mice, and 99 minutes to catch 99 mice. Now we are faced with a curious difficulty: how long will it take the same 3 cats to catch the 100th mouse?

Can you just open one drawer and take out the key?\" After thinking about it for a while, he opened a drawer according to his judgment, and the key was really there . Please think about it, which drawer is the key in?\n", "assistant": "The keys are in the middle drawer. Method 1: First, if the note on the left drawer is true, then it means \"the key is in the left drawer\"; The reverse of the note reads \"The key is in the middle drawer\". It is concluded that the keys are in the left, right, and middle drawers, but it is impossible to have keys in all three drawers; therefore, the first sentence is a lie. Secondly, if the note in the middle drawer is true, then it is \"the key is not in the middle drawer\", indicating that the key is in the left or right drawer. The note on the left drawer is \"the key is here\", because it is a lie, then the opposite is \"the key is not in the left drawer\", and the note on the right drawer should be \"the key is in the left and right drawers\", which creates a contradiction. That is, the note in the left drawer says \"not in\", and the note in the right drawer says \"in\", so it is obviously difficult to draw a conclusion. Therefore, this sentence also\nIt's a lie. Finally, if the note in the right drawer is true, \"the key is not in the left and right drawers\", that means \"the key is in the middle drawer\". The note in the left drawer, on the other hand, means \"the key is not in the left drawer\". Then, this is exactly the same as the content of the note on the right drawer, which affirms that \"the left drawer has no key\". The note in the middle says \"the key is not here\", because it is a lie, otherwise it means \"the key is here\", which just matches the content of the note in the right drawer, so it proves that the key is in the middle drawer. Method 2: In fact, the fastest way is to read the third sentence directly, which is the words on the note in the right drawer: \"The key is not in the left and right drawers\". Because the key can only be in one of the three drawers, and if the third sentence of the question is false, it means \"the key is in the left and right drawers\", which is impossible, so we can only judge it to be true, that is, \" The key is not in the left and right drawers\", since it is not in the left drawer, it can only be in the middle drawer\n", "thought": "This is a logical reasoning question that requires analysis and reasoning to find the answer.", "title": "", "command": "", "plugin": ""}

After hearing the news, the traffic police arrived and asked passers-by about the situation of the car involved in the accident, so as to catch the fleeing driver. One said the last two digits of the car's plate number were the same. The first two digits of the grade are also the same, another said. The third person said that the number has 4 digits and is a perfect square number. Although no one could tell the exact number of the plate number, the clever traffic policeman quickly learned the plate number of the escaped car based on these circumstances. Do you know how much it is?\n", "assistant": "Suppose the license plate of the car involved in the accident is x, the first two digits of this x are a, and the last two digits are b, then: x=1100a+11b=11(100a+b) (1). Since x is a perfect square number, x must contain a factor of 112, which means (100a+b) is divisible by 11. (100a+b) can be transformed into: 100a+b=99a+(a+b) (2). Therefore, (a+b) is also 11\nmultiples of . And because b is an integer from 0 to 9, and a is an integer from 1 to 9, so 1≤a+b≤18. Combined (a+b) is a multiple of 11, so a+b=11. Substitute a+b=11 into (2), and then substitute the result into (1) to get: x=11(99a+11)=112(9a+1). In order for x to be a perfect square, (9a+1) in the above formula must also be a perfect square. And because x is a perfect square number, the number b at the end of it can only be 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, and since a+b=11, a≤9, so b≤2. It can be deduced from this that b can only be 4, 5, 6, 9, and corresponding a can only be 7, 6, 5, 2. When a is 2, 5, and 6, the values ​​of (9a+1) are 19, 46, and 55 respectively, all of which are incomplete square numbers. When a=7, 9a+1=63+1=64=82, which is a perfect square number.

Although the rabbit can run faster than the wolf on the bank, the speed of rowing in the water is only 1/4 of the speed of the wolf on the bank. The wolf dared not go into the water, but it ran along the shore of the circular lake to catch the rabbits who were rowing ashore. Can the rabbit manage to row the boat to the shore and escape without being eaten by wolves?\n", "assistant": "When the rabbit is in the center of the lake and the wolf is at a certain point on the shore, if the rabbit paddles directly to the shore, it is best to paddle to the symmetrical point on the shore where the wolf is, because this point is the farthest from the wolf. At this time, the distance traveled by the rabbit is R, and the wolf has to run half a circle around the lake to intercept the rabbit on the shore. The half-circle distance is 3.14R. Since the speed of the wolf is 4 times that of the rabbit rowing the boat, the wolf can rush to the landing place of the rabbit before the rabbit paddles to the shore, and wait there to catch the rabbit. It seems that there is no way for a rabbit to escape in this way. In fact, the rabbit has a clever strategy to get to a certain point on the shore of the lake first. It can first row the boat to a certain point on a circle with the center of the lake as the center and a radius of 0.24R, and row counterclockwise (or clockwise) along the circle of this radius, because the radius of the circle is less than 0.25 of R , so the circumference of this small circle is also less than the circumference of the lake shore\n1/4. The angular velocity of the rabbit rowing in a small circle is greater than that of the wolf running along the lake, so even if the wolf is on the shore closest to the rabbit at the beginning, the rabbit will row around the circle like this, and the wolf will slowly lag behind as it runs along the shore. For the rabbit, there is always a moment when the wolf will be on the shore farthest from the rabbit, that is, at this time the rabbit and the wolf are on the left and right sides of a diameter, at this time, the closest point distance between the rabbit and the lake shore is 0.76R, and the wolf will run To that point, you have to run half the circumference of the lake, a distance of 3.14R.

In this way he distributed the whole herd among his sons, every single head left. How many sons does he have? How many cows are there?\n", "assistant": "To solve this problem arithmetically (that is, without using equations), start at the end. The youngest son shall receive as many cattle as there are sons; 1/7 of the remainder of the herd is no part to him, since after him there are no cattle left. Then, the number of cows that one of the old man's sons gets will be 1 less than the number of sons, plus 1/7 of the remaining cows. That is to say, the youngest son gets 6/7 of this remainder. It can be seen that the number of cows obtained by the youngest son should be divisible by 6. Suppose the youngest son gets 6 cows, that is to say, he is the sixth son, and that person has 6 sons in total. The fifth son deserves 5 oxen plus 1/7 of 7 oxen, or 6 oxen. Now, the fifth and sixth sons have a total of 6+6=12 cows, then the remainder of the herd after the fourth son gets 4 cows is 12/(6/7)=14 cows, the fourth A son gets 4+14/7=6 cows. Now calculate the remainder of the third son's herd of cows: 6+6+6=18, which is 6/7 of this remainder, so the full remainder should be 18/(6/7)=21. The third son deserves 3+21/7=6 cows. Using the same method, we can know that the eldest son and the second son each get 6 cows. Our hypothesis was confirmed. The answer is that there are 6 sons, each of whom gets 6 cows, and the herd consists of 36 cows. Is there another answer? Suppose the number of sons is not 6, but 12 which is a multiple of 6.

Similarly, senatorial and realization contain the same letters, and Mr. B's answer is neither one nor the other. It can be seen that one of them is a lie. These are the basis for Mr. A to determine that Mr. B's answer is a lie. From the above analysis, we can see that two of Mr. B's four answers are true and two are false. According to the meaning of the question, Mr. B answered three true sentences and three false sentences, so the other two answers of Mr. B must be one true and one false. Indeterminable s and disestablishment arianism, the last two remaining words, although the latter has many more letters than the former, in these two words, except that the latter has an h letter more than the former, the rest of the letters are the same or repeated. But Mr. B said that the letter he had in mind was in both words, and if the former word really had that letter, then there was no doubt that the latter word should also be there. In this way, both sentences become the truth, which does not match the meaning of the title. Therefore, the first sentence of Mr. B should be a lie, and the latter sentence should be the truth, that is, the letter that Mr. B thought in his mind does not exist in the former word, but this letter exists in the latter word.

This number is what Gong Yuhua thought of. But in some ways he was wrong. He thought the number was not within 500, and Chen Yijing lied to him when answering this question, so the correct number should be within 500. Gong Yuhua thinks that this number is not a square number; Chen Yijing did not tell him the truth about this, so it is a square number. Gong Yuhua thought it was a cubic number; Chen Yijing told him the truth about this, so it was a cubic number.

(4) If the murderer and the victim have different occupations, the victim is a woman. (5) If the murderer is the same gender as the victim, the murderer is a lawyer. (6) If the murderer is of a different gender than the victim, the victim is a doctor. After verification, only 3 of the 6 confessions are true. Can you infer who the murderer is? Who is the deceased?

Based on the conclusions in the statement, it is unlikely that both (2) and (5) are applicable to the actual situation. Therefore, the combination of statements that can be applied to the actual situation is one or more of the following combinations. A. (1), (4) and (5) B. (1), (3) and (5) C. (1), (4) and (6) D. (1), (3) and ( 6) E. (2), (4) and (6) F.

Therefore A does not apply. If B can be applied to the actual situation, then according to the relevant assumptions, the murderer and the victim are related and have the same occupation and gender. This contradicts the composition of individual families. Therefore B does not apply. If C can be applied to the actual situation, then according to relevant conclusions, the murderer is a male and the victim is a female doctor. Then according to the assumptions (1) and (4), the murderer is a lawyer, and the murderer is related to the victim. This contradicts the composition of individual families. Therefore C does not apply. If D can be applied to the actual situation, then according to the conclusion of (1), the murderer is male; according to the conclusion of (3), the victim is also male; but according to the assumption of (6), the murderer and the victim are of different genders. Therefore D does not apply. If E can be applied to the actual situation, according to the conclusion of (2), the murderer is a doctor; the victim is also a doctor; but according to the assumption of (4), the murderer and the victim have different occupations. Therefore E does not apply. Therefore only F can be applied to the actual situation. According to relevant conclusions, the murderer is a doctor and the victim is a male doctor. So according to the assumption of (6), the murderer is a woman. Then, according to the composition of each family, according to the conclusion of (6), the murderer can only be C. The assumption of (2) shows that the victim is B, and the assumption of (3) is consistent with the conclusions of (2) and (6).\n", "thought": "This is a logical reasoning question that requires analysis and reasoning to find the answer.", "title": "", "command": "", "plugin": ""}

(1) Take the fifth question with the most mistakes first, 44-12=32, and the result is still the most (the first question is wrong: 20 people; the second question is wrong: 28 people; the third question is wrong: 16 people). (2) The remaining 12 people with a wrong question should be selected among 1, 2, and 3, and the distribution should be even.

First, each person gets 40 points, 40x100=4000 points are consumed, and the remaining 3600 points should be allocated to as few people as possible. Because there are 56 people who may get 100 points, then 100 points will be added to these 56 people, and the remaining 3600-56x60=240 points can be distributed to 6 people, each with 40 points, so that among the 100 people, 56 people get 100 points, 6 people get 80 points, and the remaining 38 people get 40 points, that is, at least 56+6=62 people pass.\n", "thought": "This is a logical reasoning question that requires analysis and reasoning to find the answer.", "title": "", "command": "", "plugin": ""}

In theory, as long as there are enough planes, one plane can fly to infinity. Of course, it is impossible for one plane to refuel n planes at the same time within 1/(2n+1) flight time. (2) You can head on and refuel.

It can be seen from the question setting that there are at least two subjects of mathematics and English, so M≥2. And M can be divisible by 40, so M can be 2, 4, 5. Considering M=2, there are only English and mathematics subjects, and B is the first in mathematics, but the total score is only 9 points, so there must be: 9≥X +Z, X≤8, so it is impossible for A to get 22 points.

Some towns can only rely on people to transmit information between towns, as is the case in a certain area in the northwest. Telephone lines between the six small towns in the area are far from complete. There are telephone lines between town A and the other 5 small towns; but towns B and C only have telephone lines with the other 4 small towns; towns D, E, and F only have telephone lines with the other 3 small towns telephone line. Moreover, the telephone lines between these towns are all straight through, that is, they cannot be transferred. If a telephone exchange system is installed in town A, the six towns A, B, C, D, E, and F can communicate with each other. However, the telephone switching system will not be completed until half a year later. Prior to this, a direct line had to be installed between the two towns to communicate with each other. We also know that town D can call town F. May I ask: Which three small towns can E town call?\n", "assistant": "Town E can call towns A, B, and C. First of all, it is certain that there is a telephone line between town E and town A, because town A has telephone lines with the other five small towns, which of course includes town E. Which are the other two small towns? Let's reason from the two small towns B and C. Suppose there is no telephone line between the two small towns B and C. Then, the two towns B and C must be able to communicate with the four towns A, D, E, and F; if the two towns B and C respectively communicate with the four towns A, D, E, and F, then only The three towns of D, E, and F of the three telephone lines can only communicate with the three towns of A, B, and C respectively. If so, then it is impossible to communicate on the phone between D, E, and F. However, it is known that there is a telephone line between towns D and F, so the assumption that there is no telephone line between B and C cannot be established. In other words, there is a telephone line between the two small towns B and C. Then, which towns can towns B and C, which have 4 lines, communicate with? From the above reasoning, we know that towns B and C have telephone lines with town A respectively, and they have telephone lines with each other. telephone line. Where do the other two lines lead to? Assume that one of the other two lines in town B leads to town D and the other to town F; the telephone line in town C also has one to town D and the other to town F. If this assumption is true, towns D and F will each have 4 routes leading to other towns. However, we know that towns D and F only have telephone connections with 3 small towns, so the above assumption cannot be established. Assume that there are no telephone lines between towns B and C and towns D and F. If this assumption is true, then towns B and C have only 3 lines to communicate with other towns, which does not meet the known condition that B and C each have 4 telephone lines. Therefore, the above assumption does not hold. From the above analysis, it can only be deduced that towns B and C each have one telephone line leading to town E. Another route from town B leads either to town D or town F, and another route from town C leads to town D or town F. As for town E, it can definitely communicate with the three towns with answers A, B, and C.\n", "thought": "This is a logical reasoning question that requires analysis and reasoning to find the answer.", "title": "", "command": "", "plugin": ""}

According to (5), if Xiaogang has a perfect score in physics, then he also has a perfect score in English. According to (1) and (2), if Xiaogang has neither a full score in physics nor a full score in Chinese, then he must also have a full score in English. Therefore, no matter what the situation is, Xiaogang always has a perfect score in English. Therefore, according to (1), Xiaohua does not have a full score in English. According to (4), Xiaohua did not have a full score in Chinese. Therefore, according to (1) and (2), Xiaohua has both a full score in mathematics and a full score in physics. According to (1), both Xiao Ming and Xiao Gang got full marks in Chinese. So according to (2) and (3), Xiao Ming does not have a full score in mathematics. Therefore, according to (1), Xiaogang has a full score in mathematics.

Because B-C=0 at this time, A knows that the number on his head must be B+C. Therefore, BC can be deduced from the answer of A not knowing. B replied that he didn't know, what does it mean? It is still a reverse thinking, considering the circumstances under which B can know the number on his head. Like A, B can know when A=C. But in addition, B can also deduce that the number on his head is not equal to the number on C's head from A's answer that he does not know, so when A=2C, B can also deduce that the number on his head is A+C , because at this time A-C=C, and B knows that the number on his head is not equal to C. Therefore, it can be deduced from B's answer that he does not know that A=C, A+2C. C replied that he did not know. From the similar analysis above, it can be deduced that A=B, B+2A, and B-A+A/2, that is, B+3A/2, and A=2B. Finally, A answered that the number on his head was 20. So under what circumstances can A know the number on his head? There are several situations as follows. ①C=2B, at this time A knows that the number on his head cannot be C-B=B, but only C+B=3B. But 20 cannot be divisible by 3, so this situation is excluded; ②B=2C is similar to the above and is excluded. ③C=3B/2, at this time A knows that the number on his head cannot be C-B=B/2, so it can only be A=B+C=5B/2=20, B=8, and C=3B/2 =12.④C=5B/3, at this time A knows that the number on his head cannot be C-B=2B/3. It is only possible to be 8B/3, but it is found that B is not an integer, so it is excluded. ⑤C=3B. At this time, A knows that the number on his head cannot be C-B=2B, but only 4B, and deduces B=5, C=15. ⑥B=3C, at this time A knows that the number on his head cannot be B-C=2C, but only B+C=4C, and deduces B=15, C=5.

The tenth comprehensive law professor picks out a card from these 16 cards, and tells Mr. P the points of this card, and tells Mr. Q the suit of this card. Then, the professor asked Mr. P and Mr. Q: \"Can you infer what card this is from the known points or suits?\" Mr. P: \"I don't know this card.\" Mr. Q: \"I know you don't Know this card. Mr. P: \"Now I know this card. Mr. Q: \"I also know. 99 Excuse me: What is this card?\"\n", "assistant": "This card is a square 5. Mr. Q's reasoning process is as follows. Mr. P knows the points of this card, but he can't judge what kind of card it is. Obviously, the points of this card cannot be J, 8, 2, 7, 3, K, 6, because these 7 types of cards are in the There is only one of the 16 playing cards. If the points of this card are one of the above seven types of points, then Mr. P, who has sufficient reasoning ability, can immediately determine what card it is. For example, if the professor tells Mr. P that the point of this card is J, 301, then Mr. P will know immediately that this card is the J of spades. It can be seen that the points of this card can only be 4, 5, A or Q. Next, Mr. P analyzed Mr. Q's sentence \"I know you don't know this card\". Mr. Q knows the suit of this card, and at the same time makes the judgment \"I know you don't know this card\". Obviously, this card cannot be spades and clubs. Mr. P’s analysis is as follows: If this card is spades, and if the points of this card are J, 8, 3, 2, 7, Mr. P can know what card this card is; In the same way, Mr. Q cannot make such a judgment, because if the points are K and 6, Mr. P can immediately know what the card is. In this case, of course, Mr. Q cannot make \"I know You don't know this card\" assertion. Therefore, Mr. P can deduce from here that the suit of this card is either hearts or diamonds. And Mr. P, who has sufficient reasoning ability, can of course draw the same conclusion as Mr. Q when he hears Mr. Q's words. That is to say, Mr. Q's judgment of \"I know you don't know this card\" has objectively hinted the suit of this card to Mr. P. After being hinted by Mr. Q, Mr. P made the conclusion of \"now I know this card\". From this conclusion, Mr. Q, who has sufficient reasoning ability, must be able to deduce that this card is definitely not A. Why? Mr. Q thinks this way: If it is A, Mr. P who only knows the points and suit range (hearts, squares) cannot draw the conclusion of \"now I know this card\", because it may be the A of hearts, and Probably square A. Since Mr. P said \"now I know this card\", it can be seen that this card cannot be A. After excluding A, there are only 3 possibilities for this card: Queen of Hearts, 4 of Hearts, and 5 of Diamonds. In this way the range is very small. Mr. P's assertion, of course, implied this information to Mr. Q. After getting the hint from Mr. P for the second time, Mr. Q made the conclusion of \"I know it too\". From Mr. Q's conclusion, Mr. P infers that this card must be a 5 of diamonds.

Now that Mr. Q has come to the conclusion of \"I know it too\", this card is of course the 5 of diamonds.\n", "thought": "This is a logical reasoning question that requires analysis and reasoning to find the answer.", "title": "", "command": "", "plugin": ""}

{"system": "Assistant acts as a conversational robot. Each time the User enters a question, the Assistant responds accordingly. No plugins are used.", "source": "", "language": "Chinese", "user": "In a remote mountain, there is a village. There are 100 households in the village. Each household has an unmarried child. A peculiar custom has developed in this village. If the child's parents find that their child is in love, they will go to the village entrance to plant a tree on the same day to make a wish for the child. Of course, parents must have definite evidence to prove that their children are in love. Because of shyness, children will not take the initiative to tell their parents that they are in love. When other villagers find out that a child is in love, they will not tell the parents of that child, but they will pass this information on to each other in the village. Therefore, after a child falls in love, other villagers know about it except the parents. In fact, the children of these 100 households in the village are all in love, but because the villagers will not tell the parents of the children in love, no one goes to the village to plant trees. There is an old lady with a high seniority in the village. She is highly respected, honest and respectable. Everyone reports to her about the situation in the village, so she knows everything about the situation in the village, she knows that every child is in love, and of course, other villagers don't know what she knows. One day, the old man said something very common: \"At least one of your children is already in love.\" Then, something happened in the village: the first 99 days, the village was calm, but on the 100th day, all the children fell in love. Both parents went to the village to plant trees. Why is this so?\n", "assistant": "On the first day after the old lady made the announcement, if there was only one child in the village who was in love, the parents of the child would know after the old lady's announcement. Because, if other children are in love, she should know in advance, since she doesn't know and at least one child is in love, then it must be her own child. Therefore, if there is only one child in the village who is in love, the old lady will plant a tree at the entrance of the village after the announcement. The child's parents will go there that day. If there are two children in the village who are in love, the parents of the two children will not suspect their child on the first day, because they know that the other child is in love. But when they found that the child's parents did not go to the village to plant trees after the first day, then they would think that two children must be in love, otherwise the parents of the child they knew would be in love on the first day. to plant trees. Since two children are in love, but they only know one, the other must be their own. In fact, all 100 children in this village are in love. Then, this reasoning will continue until the 99th day. , every parent deduced with certainty that their child was in love, so they all went to the entrance of the village to plant trees. Here, when the old lady announces the fact that \"at least one of them is already in love\", every parent actually knows this fact (they also know the rules in the village), and the old lady's announcement of this fact does not seem to increase the number of villagers. knowledge—knowledge about the love affairs of children in the village. But why did the old lady’s announcement make the parents in the village plant trees? This is because the old lady’s announcement changed the knowledge structure in this group. It's knowledge, but not public knowledge, and the old lady's announcement made that fact public knowledge. The so-called public knowledge means that not only everyone in a group knows this fact, but everyone knows that everyone else in the group knows this fact, and everyone else knows that everyone else knows this fact... This involves an infinite number of knowing process. In the above example, before the old lady announced, it was not public knowledge for the villagers in the village that \"at least one of them is already in love\". Imagine that there are three villagers A, B, and C. Before the announcement, A thinks: \"Because I don't know that my child is in love, the other two women B and C don't know either.\" Then A thinks , B does not know whether C knows \"at least one of them is already in love\". And when the old lady announced that \"at least one of them is already in love\", \"at least one of them is already in love\" becomes public knowledge among A, B, and C. In this small village of 100 households, the old lady's announcement made \"at least one of them already in love\" public knowledge. Thus reasoning and action begin. Here's why planting trees together on the 100th day.\n", "thought": "This is a logical reasoning question that requires analysis and reasoning to find the answer.", "title": "", "command": "", "plugin": ""}

Afraid of delaying the meeting, he asked the flight attendant on the plane: \"When will the plane arrive in Guangzhou?\" \"Tomorrow morning.\" The flight attendant replied. \"What time is it in the morning?\" Seeing the scholarly manner of the deputy mayor, the stewardess tried him out intentionally: \"When we arrive in Guangzhou on time, the time displayed on the clock will be very special. The distance is 13 minutes or 26 minutes. Now can you figure out when we will arrive?\" The deputy mayor thought for a while, then asked again: \"When we arrived, did we arrive before or after 4 o'clock?\" The stewardess smiled : \"If I tell you this, of course you will know.\" The deputy mayor smiled and said, \"I will know if you don't tell me, so I can rest assured. Excuse me, what time does this plane arrive in Guangzhou?\n", "assistant": "The plane arrived in Guangzhou at 2:48 the next day. First of all, both the hour and minute hands are pointing on the minute scale line. Let's take a closer look at the structure of the clock (the watch is the same): there are 4 minute scales between each hour, and between two adjacent minute scale lines. For the hour hand, it takes 12 minutes to go, which means that this time must be n points and 12m minutes, where n is an integer from 0 to 11, and m is an integer from 0 to 4, that is, the minute hand points to 12m minutes, and the hour hand points to (5n+m) minutes s position. It is also known that the interval between the minute hand and the hour hand is 13 minutes or 26 minutes, or 12m-(5n+m)=13 or 26, or (5n+m)+(60-12m)=13 or 26, that is, either 11m-5n =13 or 26, or 60-11m+5n=13 or 26. This is a seemingly insoluble equation. However, since n and m can only be integers within a certain range, the solution can be found (it is important not to stop after finding a set of solutions, otherwise such problems cannot be solved). The deputy mayor found all three sets of solutions in this way (if you are not careful, you will declare that this problem has no solution after finding only two sets of solutions). Known: m=0, 1, 2, 3, 4; n=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Only with a fixed value range, it is not difficult to find the following three sets of solutions: (1) n=2, m=4; (2) n=4, m=3; (3) n=7, m=2. That is, three times: (1) 2:48; (2) 4:36; (3) 7:24. Faced with these three possible answers, the deputy mayor of course had to ask the flight attendant. The flight attendant's answer cleverly concealed the mechanism. The positive answer should have been before or after 4 o'clock. But if the answer is after 4 o'clock, the flight attendant's flexible answer is wrong, because the deputy mayor still can't determine whether it is 4:36 or 7:24. However, the flight attendant's flexible answer made it clear: If the answer is positive, the answer can be confirmed, which means that the positive answer can only be before 4 o'clock. That is, the time to arrive at the station on time is 2:48.\n", "thought": "This is a logical reasoning question that requires analysis and reasoning to find the answer.", "title": "", "command": "", "plugin": ""}

The reasoning can be carried out by using four planes to fly 1/4 of a plane, then the original plane flies 1/4 to 3/4 of the distance, 0 to 1/4 and 3/4 to 4/4 are refueled by tankers Supply is to give 1/2 of the oil, and the original aircraft can fly 1/4, so the two aspects of following and meeting require the oil supply machine to give half of the oil to the original aircraft at 1/4, and the oil supply machine at 1/4 Four planes are required to supply fuel to fly back after the 4 disposals, so in summary (1+4)×2=10.\n", "thought": "This is a logical reasoning question that requires analysis and reasoning to find the answer.", "title": "", "command": "", "plugin": ""}

Because the glass is very thick, the three prisoners can only see each other and cannot hear what the other party is saying. One day, the king ordered his servants to put a hat on each of them, telling them that the hats were only red and black, but not letting them know what color the hats they were wearing were. On this occasion, the king pronounced two orders as follows:\n1. Any prisoner who can see that the other two prisoners are wearing red hats can release him;\n2. Any prisoner who knows that he is wearing a black hat can also be released.\nIn fact, all three of them wore black hats. It's just that they couldn't see their own because they were tied up.

Therefore, it can be proved that there are no 2 red hats among the 3 hats, and it can also be said that there may be 2 blacks and 1 red among the three people, or 3 blacks. So there are two situations: Suppose A is wearing a red hat, so he sees 2 black hats. Both B and C can see 1 black and 1 red. But since the red one is on A's head, then both B and C are black. Then B and C can be sure that they are wearing black hats. So it is impossible for A to wear a red hat. Therefore, A presumes that what he is wearing on his head must be a black hat. Because only when there are 3 black hats, no one can be sure whether the red hat is on his head.

It is not difficult to find through observation that only the two groups of dates, June 7 and December 2, have unique numbers of days. It can be seen from this that if Xiaohong knows that N is 7 or 2, then she must know when the teacher's birthday is.\nAgain, let's analyze what Xiao Liu said. Xiao Liu said: \"If I don't know, Xiaohong certainly doesn't know.\" The months of the 10 groups of dates are 3, 6, 9, 12, and the corresponding There are more than two sets of dates for the month, so it is impossible for Xiao Liu to know the teacher's birthday after learning about M.\nAfter further analysis, Xiao Liu said: \"If I don't know, Xiaohong definitely doesn't know either.\" From conclusion 2, we can know that Xiaohong will never know after learning about N.\nThen, combining the analysis of 1 and 3, it can be deduced that all the dates in June and December are not the teacher’s birthday, because if Xiao Liu knows that M is 6, and if Xiao Hong’s N=7, then Xiao Hong will know teacher's birthday.\nIn the same way, if Xiao Liu's M=12, and Xiao Hong's N=2, then Xiao Hong can also know the teacher's birthday. That is: M is not equal to 6 and 9. Now there are only five sets of dates left: \"March 4, March 5, March 8, September 1, September 5\".

No, one for 10 minutes. If so, no problem. May said confidently. But what's in this safe? It's empty.

The criminal police inspected the scene and just left. I wanted you, the famous detective, to also investigate.\" \"Investigation What scene?\" \"A burglar came in. Please come in and discuss the details.\" After letting Detective Samson into the living room, Holman immediately introduced what happened. \"Yesterday morning, a misfortune happened to a relative's house, so my wife and I went out together. This afternoon, I went home first to have a look, and when I entered the house, I found that the house was in a mess. It must be that a thief came in when there was no one at home, yes From that window.\" Holman pointed to the window facing the yard. I saw a round hole was cut in the glass of that window with a glass knife. The criminal reached in and pulled the latch to get in. \"So, what was stolen?\" \"No valuables, just a camera and his wife's gemstones. Except for the pearl necklace, they are all fakes. Hahaha...\" \"During the on-site investigation, the criminal police found something powerful. Is there any evidence?\" \"No, I returned empty-handed. The criminal didn't leave a single fingerprint, so he must have been an experienced sneaker. As far as evidence is concerned, there are only five or six pearls on the pearl necklace that were thrown in the yard.\" \"Is it the pearl from the stolen pearl necklace?\" \"Yes. The thread of that necklace was originally broken. Maybe the criminal stole it and put it in the pocket of his clothes, and there was a hole in the pocket.\" Huo Erman led Samson into the courtyard where the sun was shining. Tulips of red, white and yellow are blooming in the flower beds in the yard. \"Hey, sir, there's a pearl in the middle of this flower too.\" Samson noticed a white pearl in the middle of a yellow flower. \"Which, which...\" Holman also leaned over to look at the flower. \"It seems that this is an omission by the surveyors.\" \"Do you know when this flower bloomed?\" \"Probably the day before yesterday. Yellow tulips always bloom first, and I remember it clearly.\" Holman replied, And carefully and gently remove the pearl from the middle of the petal. This evening, Holman cooks the dishes himself. While the two were eating sukiyaki, the criminal police called and informed Holman of the search situation, saying that two suspects had been caught and were currently being interrogated.

He secretly went to spy on the scene around 10 o'clock last night, and was spotted by patrolling police who occasionally passed by. \"One of these two people must be a criminal.

Tulips.\" Surprised, Holman immediately picked up the flashlight and went to the yard to check in doubt. Because the light bulbs in the yard were broken, the flower beds were very dark.

Suddenly, Mrs. Shire in mourning hurried to find the captain and said, \"Oops, the urn I brought is missing!\" The captain listened to Mrs. Shire's words, Disapprovingly, he smiled and said to her: \"Madam, don't worry! Think about it carefully, no one will steal the urn!\" \"No no!\" Mrs. Shire's brow was sweating, and she explained repeatedly, \"It's inside Not only my father's ashes, but also three diamonds worth 30,000 marks.\" Before World War II, Mrs. Shire's father, Professor Ke Lun, was hired by the University of Toronto to teach. When war broke out, he stayed in Canada out of dissatisfaction with Hitler's fascist regime. Time flies slowly for decades. At first he was away alone, and then his eldest daughter, Mrs. Shire, went to Canada to take care of his life. In the spring of this year, Professor Kelun suddenly became seriously ill and was bedridden. When he was dying, he asked his daughter to bring his ashes back to Germany, and exchange his savings for many years into diamonds for his three daughters in Germany. Mrs. Shire said to the captain in great frustration: \"It is because of this that I always keep the urn with me. I think that no one will steal the urn. I didn't expect that I have not returned to my hometown and my three younger sisters have not seen each other. The ashes of my father, but today...\" After hearing the story, the captain immediately investigated all the people on the yacht who had been in Mrs. Shire's cabin, and recorded the following situation—Mrs. Shire's girlfriend, Frost: 9:00 Enter the cabin left and right to chat with Mrs. Shire; at 9:05, because the waiter Anna came to tidy up the cabin, the two went to the deck to chat. Mrs. Shire herself: At 9:10, she returned to her stateroom to retrieve her camera and found Anna, the attendant, flipping through her bedside table. Madame Shire reprimanded her angrily. The two quarreled for 10 minutes until 9:20; at 9:25, his girlfriend Frost entered the cabin again and invited Mrs. Shire to go to the Jia Bridge to enjoy the scenery on both sides of the strait. Mrs. Shire did not agree because she was in a bad mood. After the waiter left at 9:30, Mrs. Shire found that the urn had disappeared... If the facts stated by Mrs. Shire are to be believed, then the thief must be one of Anna and Frost, but Not sure who. When he was in trouble, a crew member reported to the captain: \"I vaguely saw a small purple-red wooden box bouncing up and down in the waves at the stern.\" So he made a decisive decision and ordered to return to search. It was 10:30 at this time. At 11:45, I finally caught up with the small book box that was drifting downstream on the river. Fished it up immediately. Mrs. Shire identified this small wooden box as her father's urn, but the three diamonds in the urn were gone. At this time, the captain took out his notebook again, carefully analyzed the situation just recorded, and finally concluded that the person who pried open the urn to steal the diamond, and then threw the urn into the river. The result of solving the case is consistent with the captain's conclusion. Do you know who stole these diamonds?\n", "assistant": "To know who committed the crime, it is necessary to infer who has the time and conditions to commit the crime.

Because the drifting distance of the small wooden box plus the distance traveled by the boat upstream to catch up with the small wooden box is equal to the distance the boat traveled downstream during the period from 10:30 to 11:45, that is: (v-u) (10: 30-t)+(11:45-t)u=(u+v)(11:45-10:30) Solve this equation and get t=9:15. Therefore, the time to drop the urn is 9:15 , and at this time Anna was arguing with Mrs. Shire, she could not have committed the crime; therefore it was Frost who committed the crime.\n", "thought": "This is a logical reasoning question that requires analysis and reasoning to find the answer.", "title": "", "command": "", "plugin": ""}

Graduate student Yan Qinxue died on the highest platform of the Observation Tower, with no obvious injuries on his body. After careful examination, it was found that Yan Qinxue's right eye had been pricked by a thin poisonous needle about 3 cm long. Next to his body, there is a blood-stained needle. Judging from the situation at the scene, Yan Qinxue obviously died after pulling out the poisonous needle in his eye. This matter has not been disclosed to the public yet, and no clues have been found. Now the entire Academy of Sciences has caused a great commotion over this matter. The Star Observation Tower is an independent unit. Moreover, the gate below is locked and cannot be opened without a key, and there is no trace of prying it open. Yan Qinxue may have locked the gate before going to the platform. So we speculate that the murderer must not have entered through the gate of the clock tower. The location of this platform is on the south side of the fourth floor. It is about 26 meters above the ground. There is a river next to the Star Observation Tower. There is also a distance of 40 meters from the clock tower to the opposite bank. Last night there was a big wind Wind, even if the murderer fired a fine poisonous needle with a flute from the opposite bank, it was impossible to hit Yan Qinxue's right eye so accurately. However, Yan Qinxue was shot in the right eye by this poisonous needle and died. So who is the murderer? And what method was used to kill people? This is really a puzzling case. The dean of the Academy of Sciences regarded Yan Qinxue's death as a suicide, and wanted to simply hold a funeral for him in the courtyard. What about suicide in this way? At this time, all the people in the Academy of Sciences were talking about it, especially Professor Pan, who was closest to Yan Qinxue, even disagreed with the conclusion made by the academy. So an investigation was launched, determined to find out the murderer and avenge Yan Qinxue. From the investigation process, I know that Yan Qinxue secretly observes the activities of the stars and the moon in the star observatory every night in order to better study everything in space. The strong wind and heavy rain never stop. It strengthened Professor Pan's confidence and insisted that Yan Qinxue was killed rather than committed suicide. Professor Pan investigated the students closest to Yan Qinxue, and learned that Yan Qinxue was the son of a wealthy businessman, and he had a half-brother. His father died of illness this summer, and Yan Qinxue planned to use his That legacy, all donated to the Academy of Sciences. However, Yan Qinxue's younger brother thought that his approach was quite stupid. He once threatened Yan Qinxue that if he did not stop his unwise act immediately, he would sue the court and ban Yan Qinxue's inheritance rights. \"The day before this case happened, Yan Qinxue's younger brother sent a small package. Yan Qinxue didn't tell anyone what was in the package. When I came to clean the room yesterday, I didn't see the small package. Maybe, the murderer murdered Yan Qinxue in order to steal the small package.\" The cleaner in the courtyard said the above words to Professor Pan. The elderly Professor Pan closed his eyes at this moment, thinking quietly, and opened his eyes again, looking at the rippling river flowing leisurely. At this time, Professor Pan discussed the truth of the incident with the police. \"This is my conjecture based on the situation. Judging the case based on common sense and observation will not be too far apart. Before the case is made public, can I ask people to salvage the river? Although I have a very good reasoning, but If there is no evidence, no one is willing to bow their heads and plead guilty, and my reasoning is just a hypothesis.\" Who is the murderer of Yan Qinxue? What about Professor Pan's ingenious reasoning?\n", "assistant": "\"Afterwards, I finally found this telescope at the bottom of the river. It was a telescope only forty centimeters long. The small package that Yan Qinxue's younger brother sent must be this telescope! But how could this telescope be related to the murder case? \"Professor Pan looked at the telescope carefully, and said after a while: \"My guess is correct. This telescope can be disassembled at any time. Yan Qinxue's younger brother put a fine poisonous needle in the lens barrel of this telescope. When Yan Qinxue put the telescope on the glasses, he turned the screw in the center of the lens barrel by hand to adjust the lens focus. Yan Qinxue panicked and threw the binoculars out of his hand. The binoculars fell into the river below the tower just like that. Although Yan Qinxue pulled out the poisonous needle in the eye in time, it was faster his death.\"\n", "thought": "This is a logical reasoning question that requires analysis and reasoning to find the answer.", "title": "", "command": "", "plugin": ""}

After calling the police, Scotland Yard (that is, London Police Headquarters) immediately dispatched a large number of criminal police to the scene of the crime. Based on the fingerprints, footprints, and traces of struggle left by the criminals at the scene, the police concluded that the three criminals had committed the crimes separately (it was later confirmed that this judgment was correct). After several months of investigation, a large amount of conclusive evidence was finally collected, and three criminals A, B, and C were arrested. During the interrogation, the confessions of the three criminals were as follows: A confessed: 1. C was a murderer, and he killed the members of the House of Commons purely to avenge his past personal revenge. 2. Since I was arrested, of course I have to make up a statement, so I am not a very honest person. 3. B is a rapist because B is possessive of beautiful women. B confessed: 1. A is a famous thief.

Among the three criminals, one of the confessions was all the truth, one was the most dishonest, and all he said were lies, and the other's confession contained both truth and lies.

It is better to start with A's confession. A said: \"Since I have been arrested, of course I have to make up a statement, so I am not a very honest person.\" Analyzing this sentence, it can be inferred that A's statement is true or false. Because, if A's statement is all true, then he will not say that he made up the statement; if A's statement is all false, then he will not say that he is not very honest. Since A's statement is either true or false, then B's statement is either completely true or completely false. And B said: \"A never tells the truth.\" From this, it can be seen that this sentence of B is false, and it can be judged that what B said cannot be completely true, but completely false. Since B's statement is all false, then C's statement is all true. And C said that A was the criminal who killed the member of the House of Commons, B was not the perpetrator of the theft, so B is the rapist, and the criminal who stole the oil painting can only be C himself.\n", "thought": "This is a logical reasoning question that requires analysis and reasoning to find the answer.", "title": "", "command": "", "plugin": ""}

The body of Dr. Ding, who lived alone in the suburbs, was found by his helper Zhao Ma the next morning. The corpse fell in the middle of the study, and was shot in the chest. Electric lamps with shades hung from the ceiling, and the 80-watt incandescent lamps were still on. Dr. Ding was wearing a gown and fell under the lamp. The windows were closed and the curtains were drawn. There was a bullet hole in the curtain and glass, and the time of death was estimated to be around 9 o'clock last night. Zhao, the head of the investigation section, and Xiao Wang, his assistant, were ordered to arrive and looked around the room. The local security chief gave a brief introduction to the situation: \"The prisoner shot from the miscellaneous forest opposite the yard, at a distance of about 40 meters. One shot hit, and the marksmanship is sure to be good. According to this, the prisoner will be found soon.\" Zhao Que raised a question: \"The fabric of the black curtains is very thick. Even if the lights in the house are turned on, the shadows in the room cannot be reflected outside. Moreover, Dr. Ding was shot under the electric light, and his shadow will not be reflected. Then, how did the prisoner aim and shoot? Could it be that he was hit by accident?\" The chief of security couldn't answer Zhao's question, so he had to agree to do an experiment when it was dark. At this time, Section Chief Zhao saw the light switch next to the door, and tried to press it two or three times. There was nothing abnormal about the light in the study turning on and off. After testing, Section Chief Zhao's doubts were confirmed. \"From the gap in the curtains, we can still tell whether the indoor lights are turned on. However, the criminal hit him with only one shot. He is indeed a sharpshooter. Maybe the criminal aimed with confidence.\" The security captain felt a little strange. \"Have you roughly figured out who the prisoner is?\" Old Zhao asked directly. \"There are two major suspects, Dr. Ding's two nephews, Li Ming and Li Xiang. The doctor is single now and has no will, and the estate will be inherited by the two of them. The doctor has a considerable amount of inheritance. Then I asked Li Ming and Li Xiang. Because there is no conclusive evidence, the case cannot be finalized. In fact, on the night of the incident, the two had dinner at their uncle’s house. After that, the three of them talked in the living room next to the study. It is said that at 8:30 , Li Ming and Li Xiang went home, and the helper Zhao Ma left at 7:30. During this time, the two nephews each went into the study once. First, Li Ming was chatting, and the doctor’s cigarettes were exhausted. Before leaving, Li Xiang borrowed books from the study and went back. During the period, Dr. Ding never entered the study.

According to them, After saying goodbye in front of his uncle's house, one went back to the left and the other to the right. Section Chief Zhao thought of this, closed his eyes and meditated. After a while, Section Chief Zhao suddenly opened his eyes and said to the security captain: \"According to Mama Zhao , When the body was found, was the light in the study still on?\" \"Yes, the light was on. \"Then I know who the murderer is.\" The prisoner cleverly used the electric light to attack the doctor. \"So, according to Section Chief Zhao's reasoning, which of the two nephews is the real criminal?\n", "assistant": "The criminal is Lixiang.

So, he went to turn on the switch on the lamp holder, or put in a new bulb to brighten the light. At this time, no matter what, the doctor was standing directly under the lamp.

Pairs are not equal 3. Any number is not twice the other number. Each number may be the sum or difference of the other two. If the third person can guess 144, one of the possibilities must be ruled out based on the previous three conditions. Assumption: It is the difference between two numbers, namely x-y=144.

It is therefore the sum of the two numbers, ie x+y=144. In the same way, at this time, both 1 and 2 are satisfied, and 3 must be dissatisfied, that is, x-y=2y. If the two equations are combined, x=108 and y=36 can be obtained.\nThe order of these two rounds of guessing is actually as follows: the first round (number one, number two), the second round (number three, number one, number two). In this way, the information obtained by everyone at the end of each round is the same (ie the previous three conditions).\nThen suppose we are C, let’s see how C made it: what C sees is 36 of A and 108 of B, because of the condition, the sum of the two numbers is the third, then he is either 72 or 144 (I guess this is because of 72, 108 is the sum of 36 and 72, and 144 is the sum of 108 and 36.

The following is what C thinks if B is 36: In this case, what C sees is A’s 36 and B's 36, then he can guess himself, it is 72 or 0 (this will not be explained):\nIf you assume that you (C) have 0 on your head, then A can see it in the first round.

(Then reverse and reverse), now A did not report his own 36 in the first round, C (in B's imagination) can know that his head is not 0, if the other is the same as B's idea (referring to B's head is 36), then C can report his own 72 in the first round. Now C did not report his own 36 in the first round, B (in C's imagination) can know that his head is not 36, if the other is the same as C's idea (referring to C's head is 72), then B in the first round You can report your own 108 in the second round.

Besides, no two pirates are equal - the pirates are ranked in a completely top-to-bottom hierarchy, and each knows his own rank and everyone else's rank. The nuggets could not be divided, and several pirates were not allowed to share the nuggets, since no pirate could trust his fellows to abide by the arrangement regarding the sharing of nuggets.

His chance of survival depends entirely on the fact that there are still people surviving in front of him, because if all the pirates No. 1 to No. 3 feed the sharks, then when only No. 4 and No. 5 are left, no matter what No. 4 proposes Whatever the distribution plan, No. 5 will definitely vote against it so that No. 4 can feed the sharks to swallow all the gold coins.

Therefore, the rational No. 4 should not take such risks and pin his hope of survival on the random selection of No. 5. Only by supporting No. 3 can he absolutely guarantee his own life.\nLook at No. 3 again.

Plus his own 1 vote can make him secure the 100 gold coins. But No. 2 also learned the distribution plan of No. 3 through reasoning, then he will propose a plan of (98,0,1,1). Because this plan is compared with the distribution plan of No. 3, No. 4 and No. 5 can get at least 1 gold coin. Rational No. 4 and No. 5 will naturally feel that this plan is more beneficial to them and support No. 2, and do not want No. 2 Out of the game and assigned by the 3rd. In this way, No. 2 can take 98 gold coins away. Unfortunately, Pirate No. 1 is not a fuel-efficient lamp, and after some reasoning, he also has insight into the distribution plan of No. 2.

Or die together (all take 20)\nOf course No. 3 is afraid of dying together, because No. 4 and No. 5 think that they are all dead anyway, so it's better to kill them all.\nSo look at number 3 taking 19 pieces, leaving 41 pieces, it can be 20+20, 20+19, 20+21, no matter what, number 3 is dead.\nSo No. 3 only dared to take 20. Because if you can't survive, you can get all of them to die together.\nThen No. 4 is also afraid of all 20 pieces, but 21 pieces cannot be taken, so he takes 19 pieces.\nThere are 61 left, which can be 20+20+19, 20+20+20, 20+20+21, he is dead no matter what!\nSo No. 4 has no choice but to take 20. At least you can get all 20 of them to die together.\nEmpathy! No. 5 can only take 20 pieces!\nIf this continues, 1-5 will take 20 pieces, and they will die together!\nBecause anyone who gets more than 21 or less than 19 (including) is dead alone or only a few.\n", "thought": "This is a logical reasoning question that requires analysis and reasoning to find the answer.", "title": "", "command": "", "plugin": ""}

It can be seen from this that if Xiaoqiang knows that N is 7 or 2, then he must know the teacher's birthday.\n2) Then analyze \"Xiao Ming said: If I don't know, Xiao Qiang certainly doesn't know\", and the months of the 10 groups of dates are 3, 6, 9, and 12, and there are more than two groups of dates in the corresponding months , so it is impossible for Xiao Ming to know the teacher's birthday after learning about M.\n3) Further analysis of \"Xiao Ming said: If I don't know, Xiao Qiang definitely doesn't know either\", combined with the conclusion of step 2, it can be seen that Xiao Qiang will never know after learning N.\n4) Combining step 3 and step 1, it can be inferred that all the dates in June and December are not the teacher's birthday, because if Xiao Ming knows that M is 6, and if Xiao Qiang's N==7, then Xiao Qiang knows It's the teacher's birthday. (Already launched from step 1) Similarly, if Xiaoming's M==12, if Xiaoqiang's N==2, then Xiaoqiang can also know the teacher's birthday. That is: M is not equal to 6 and 9.

Mr. Q: I know you don't know this card. Mr. P: Now I know this card. Mr. Q: I also know. After listening to the above conversation, Mr. S thought for a while, and then correctly deduced what card this card is. Question: What is this card?\n", "assistant": "cube 5\n[9] A professor of logic has three students, and all three students are very smart! One day the professor asked them a question. The professor put a note on everyone's forehead and told them that each person wrote a positive integer on the note, and the sum of two numbers equals the third! (Everyone can see the other two numbers, but not their own) The professor asked the first student: Can you guess your own number? Answer: No, ask the second one, no, the third one, no, ask the first one again, no, the second one, no, the third one: I guessed it, it is 144! The professor smiled with satisfaction. Can you guess the number of the other two?\nAfter the first round, it means that any two numbers are different. In the second round, the first two people did not guess it, which means that no number is twice the other number. Now there are the following conditions: 1. Each number is greater than 02. Pairs are not equal 3. Any number is not twice the other number. Each number may be the sum or difference of the other two. If the third person can guess 144, one of the possibilities must be ruled out based on the previous three conditions. Assumption: It is the difference between two numbers, namely x-y=144. At this time, 1(x, y>0) and 2(x!=y) are both satisfied, so negating x+y must make 3 unsatisfactory, that is, x+y=2y, x=y is solved, which is not true (otherwise the first round would be can be guessed), so it is not the difference between two numbers. It is therefore the sum of the two numbers, ie x+y=144. In the same way, at this time, both 1 and 2 are satisfied, and 3 must be dissatisfied, that is, x-y=2y. If the two equations are combined, x=108 and y=36 can be obtained.\nThe order of these two rounds of guessing is actually as follows: the first round (number one, number two), the second round (number three, number one, number two). In this way, the information obtained by everyone at the end of each round is the same (ie the previous three conditions).\nThen suppose we are C, let’s see how C made it: what C sees is 36 of A and 108 of B, because of the condition, the sum of the two numbers is the third, then he is either 72 or 144 (I guess this is because of 72, 108 is the sum of 36 and 72, and 144 is the sum of 108 and 36. Raise your hand if you don’t understand this sentence):\nAssuming that he (C) is 72, then B can see it in the second round. The following is if C is 72, B’s thinking: In this case, what B sees is A’s 36 and C’s 72 , then he can guess himself, it is 36 or 108 (guess this because of 36, 36 plus 36 equals 72, and 108 is the sum of 36 and 108):\nIf you assume that you (B) have 36 on your head, then C can see it in the first round. The following is what C thinks if B is 36: In this case, what C sees is A’s 36 and B's 36, then he can guess himself, it is 72 or 0 (this will not be explained):\nIf you assume that you (C) have 0 on your head, then A can see it in the first round. The following is what A thinks if C is 0: In this case, what A sees is B’s 36 and C is 0, then he can guess himself, it is 36 or 36 (this will not be explained anymore), then he can report the 36 on his head in one go. (Then reverse and reverse), now A did not report his own 36 in the first round, C (in B's imagination) can know that his head is not 0, if the other is the same as B's idea (referring to B's head is 36), then C can report his own 72 in the first round. Now C did not report his own 36 in the first round, B (in C's imagination) can know that his head is not 36, if the other is the same as C's idea (referring to C's head is 72), then B in the first round You can report your own 108 in the second round. Now that B did not report his 108 in the second round, C can know that his head is not 72, so the only possibility of C's head is 144.\n", "thought": "This is a logical reasoning question that requires analysis and reasoning to find the answer.", "title": "", "command": "", "plugin": ""}

At noon, Santini hadn't returned, but a young officer from the Minister's Department came and informed Napoleon, \"Your servant has been arrested on suspicion of theft.\"\nNapoleon rushed to the Minister's Department, and Roy told him what happened: \"When Santini came here, I was dealing with the gold coins handed over by the islanders, so I asked the secretary to let him wait in the room on the left.

Think about it, no one will steal the urn!\"\n\"No no!\" Mrs. Charles explained repeatedly with sweat on her forehead, \"It not only contains my father's ashes, but also three diamonds worth 30,000 marks.\"\nBefore World War II, Mrs. Shire's father, Professor Ke Lun, was hired by the University of Toronto to teach. When war broke out, he stayed in Canada out of dissatisfaction with Hitler's fascist regime. Time flies slowly for decades.\nAt first he was away alone, and then his eldest daughter, Mrs. Shire, went to Canada to take care of his life. In the spring of this year, Professor Kelun suddenly became seriously ill and was bedridden. When he was dying, he asked his daughter to bring his ashes back to Germany, and exchange his savings for many years into diamonds for his three daughters in Germany.\nMrs. Shire said to the captain in great frustration: \"It is because of this that I always keep the urn with me. I think that no one will steal the urn. I didn't expect that I have not returned to my hometown and my three younger sisters have not yet seen each other.\" to the ashes of my father, but today...\"\nAfter hearing the reason, the captain immediately investigated all the people on the yacht who had entered Mrs. Shire's cabin, and recorded the following situation——\nFrau Shire's girlfriend:\nEnter the cabin around 9 o'clock to chat with Mrs. Shire;\nAt 9:05, the waiter Anna came to tidy up the cabin and the two went to the deck to chat.\nMrs. Shire herself:\nAt 9:10, I went back to the cabin to pick up the camera and found that the attendant Anna was turning over her bedside table. Madame Shire reprimanded her angrily. The two argued for 10 minutes until 9:20;\nAt 9:25, his girlfriend Frost entered the cabin again and invited Mrs. Charles to go to Jiaqiao to enjoy the scenery on both sides of the strait. Mrs. Charles did not agree because she was in a bad mood.\nAfter the waiter left at 9:30, Mrs. Shire found that the urn had disappeared...\nIf the facts stated by Mrs. Shire are to be believed, the thief must be one of Anna and France, but it is impossible to say who.\nWhile in trouble, a crew member reported to the captain:\n\"I vaguely saw a small purple-red wooden box bobbing up and down in the waves at the stern.\"\nThe captain rushed to the stern and saw that it was exactly as the crew said. So he made a decisive decision and ordered to return to search. It was 10:30 at this time.\nAt 11:45, I finally caught up with the small book box that was drifting downstream on the river. Fished it up immediately.\nMrs. Shire identified this small wooden box as her father's urn, but the three diamonds in the urn were gone.\nAt this time, the captain took out his notebook again, carefully analyzed the situation just recorded, and finally concluded that the person who pried open the urn to steal the diamond, and then threw the urn into the river.\nThe result of solving the case is consistent with the captain's conclusion.\nDo you know who stole these diamonds?\n", "assistant": "To know who committed the crime, it is necessary to infer who has the time and conditions to commit the crime. We might as well calculate it like this:\nSuppose the speed of the water flow is u, and the speed of the boat in still water is v, then the speed of the boat is v+u when it is going downstream; the speed when it is going upstream is v-u; and the time for dropping the urn is t.\nBecause the drifting distance of the small wooden box plus the distance traveled by the boat upstream to catch up with the small wooden box is equal to the distance traveled downstream by the boat during the period from 10:30 to 11:45.\nThat is: (v-u)(10:30-t)+(11:45-t)u=(u+v)(11:45-10:30)\nSolve this equation and get t=9:15 points\nThus, the time at which the urn is dropped is 9:15, when Anna is quarreling with Mrs. Shire, and she cannot have committed the crime; therefore it is Floss.\n", "thought": "This is a logical reasoning question that requires analysis and reasoning to find the answer.", "title": "", "command": "", "plugin": ""}

Graduate student Yan Qinxue died on the highest platform of the Observation Tower, with no obvious injuries on his body. After careful examination, it was found that Yan Qinxue's right eye had been pricked by a thin poisonous needle about 3 cm long. Next to his body, there is a blood-stained needle. Judging from the situation at the scene, Yan Qinxue obviously died after pulling out the poisonous needle in his eye. This matter has not been disclosed to the public yet, and no clues have been found. Now the entire Academy of Sciences has caused a great commotion over this matter.\nThe Star Observation Tower is an independent unit. Moreover, the gate below is locked and cannot be opened without a key, and there is no trace of prying it open. Yan Qinxue may have locked the gate before going to the platform. So we speculate that the murderer must not have entered through the gate of the clock tower.\nThe location of this platform is on the south side of the fourth floor. It is about 26 meters above the ground. There is a river next to the Star Observation Tower. There is also a distance of 40 meters from the clock tower to the opposite bank. Last night there was a big wind Wind, even if the murderer fired a fine poisonous needle with a flute from the opposite bank, it was impossible to hit Yan Qinxue's right eye so accurately.\nHowever, Yan Qinxue was shot in the right eye by this poisonous needle and died. So who is the murderer? And what method was used to kill people? This is really a puzzling case.\nThe dean of the Academy of Sciences regarded Yan Qinxue's death as a suicide, and wanted to simply hold a funeral for him in the courtyard. What about suicide in this way?\nAt this time, all the people in the Academy of Sciences were talking about it, especially Professor Pan, who was closest to Yan Qinxue, even disagreed with the conclusion made by the academy. So an investigation was launched, determined to find out the murderer and avenge Yan Qinxue.\nFrom the investigation process, I know that Yan Qinxue secretly observes the activities of the stars and the moon in the star observatory every night in order to better study everything in space. The strong wind and heavy rain never stop. It strengthened Professor Pan's confidence and insisted that Yan Qinxue was killed rather than committed suicide.\nProfessor Pan investigated the students closest to Yan Qinxue, and learned that Yan Qinxue was the son of a wealthy businessman, and he had a half-brother. His father died of illness this summer, and Yan Qinxue planned to use his That legacy, all donated to the Academy of Sciences. However, Yan Qinxue's younger brother thought that his approach was quite stupid. He once threatened Yan Qinxue that if he did not stop his unwise act immediately, he would sue the court and ban Yan Qinxue's inheritance rights.\n\"The day before this case happened, Yan Qinxue's younger brother sent a small package. Yan Qinxue didn't tell anyone what was in the package. When I came to clean the room yesterday, I didn't see the small package. Maybe, the murderer murdered Yan Qinxue in order to steal the small package.\" The cleaner in the courtyard said the above words to Professor Pan.\nThe elderly Professor Pan closed his eyes at this moment, thinking quietly, and opened his eyes again, looking at the rippling river flowing leisurely. At this time, Professor Pan discussed the truth of the incident with the police.\n\"This is my conjecture based on the situation. Judging the case based on common sense and observation will not be too far apart. Before the case is made public, whether I can ask someone to salvage the river? Although I have a very good reasoning, but If there is no evidence, no one is willing to bow their heads and plead guilty, and my reasoning is nothing more than a hypothesis.\"\nWho is the murderer who killed Yan Qinxue? What about Professor Pan's ingenious reasoning?\n", "assistant": "\"Afterwards, I finally found this telescope at the bottom of the river. It was a telescope only forty centimeters long. The small package that Yan Qinxue's younger brother sent must be this telescope! But how could this telescope be related to the murder case? \"\nProfessor Pan looked carefully through the telescope and said after a while:\n\"My guess is correct. This telescope can be disassembled at any time. Yan Qinxue's younger brother put a fine poisonous needle in the lens barrel of this telescope. When Yan Qinxue put the telescope on the glasses, he turned the mirror by hand. The screw in the center of the lens barrel was used to adjust the focus of the lens. The fine poisonous needle hidden in the lens barrel jumped out under the rebound force of the spring, and happened to pierce Yan Qinxue's right eye. Yan Qinxue panicked and threw the telescope out of his hand. , The telescope fell into the river below the tower in this way, although Yan Qinxue pulled out the poisonous needle stuck in the eye in time, but this hastened his death.\"\n", "thought": "This is a logical reasoning question that requires analysis and reasoning to find the answer.", "title": "", "command": "", "plugin": ""}

One is a murder case, a member of the House of Commons living on the 4th floor was shot dead with a pistol; the other is a theft case, 6 oil paintings from the 16th century collected by a famous painting collector living on the second floor were stolen; Rape, a beautiful ballerina living on the ground floor was raped by thugs.\nAfter calling the police, Scotland Yard (that is, London Police Headquarters) immediately dispatched a large number of criminal police to the scene of the crime. Based on the fingerprints, footprints, and traces of struggle left by the criminals at the scene, the police concluded that the three criminals had committed the crimes separately (it was later confirmed that this judgment was correct).\nAfter several months of investigation, a large amount of conclusive evidence was finally collected, and three criminals A, B, and C were arrested. During the interrogation, the statements of the three criminals were as follows:\nA confessed:\n1. C is a murderer. He killed members of the House of Commons purely to avenge his past personal revenge.\n2. Since I was arrested, of course I have to make up a statement, so I am not a very honest person.\n3. B is a rapist because B is possessive of beautiful women.\nB confessed:\n1. A is a famous thief. I firmly believe that he was the one who stole the oil painting that night.\n2. A never tells the truth.\n3. C is a rapist.\nC confessed:\n1. The theft was not done by B.\n2. A is a murderer.\n3. In short, I confess that I did commit crimes in this apartment that night.\nAmong the three criminals, one of the confessions was all the truth, one was the most dishonest, and all he said were lies, and the other's confession contained both truth and lies.\nWhich case A, B, and C did respectively, after reading the confession, Interpol Henry has already made a judgment.\ndo you know?\n", "assistant": "Henry said that this case can be started by analyzing the statements of A, B, and C. It is better to start with A's confession.\nA said: \"Since I was arrested, of course I have to make up a statement, so I am not a very honest person.\"\nAnalyzing this sentence, it can be inferred that A's confession is true or false. Because, if A's statement is all true, then he will not say that he made up the statement; if A's statement is all false, then he will not say that he is not very honest.\nSince A's statement is either true or false, then B's statement is either completely true or completely false.\nAnd B said: \"A never tells the truth.\" From this, it can be seen that this sentence of B is false, and it can be judged that what B said cannot be completely true, but completely false.\nSince B's statement is all false, then C's statement is all true. And C said that A was the criminal who killed the member of the House of Commons, B was not the perpetrator of the theft, so B is the rapist, and the criminal who stole the oil painting can only be C himself.\n", "thought": "This is a logical reasoning question that requires analysis and reasoning to find the answer.", "title": "", "command": "", "plugin": ""}

From this sunken ship, divers from country G salvaged the bodies of many victims, and one of them could be identified as a lieutenant from the military uniform. On the chest of the corpse was a lead box containing top-secret documents.\nOpen the lead box and find 3 cipher books - one is the strategic cipher used by the navy of country Q; the other is the tactical cipher used by the navy of country Q; the other is the commercial cipher of country Q. This discovery makes G country ecstatic. Therefore, they immediately organized a cryptanalysis organization directly under the Navy Headquarters, which was presided over by Rear Admiral Reginald Hall, the director of G's Naval Intelligence Bureau, code-named \"04 Post Office\". This cryptanalysis organization has gathered dozens of authoritative linguists, mathematicians and computer technology experts. After several months of intense work, most of the codes were finally deciphered.\nRelying on these three codebooks, country G has continuously intercepted a lot of valuable information, including the battle order and firepower distribution of country Q's fleets on various oceans, and the activities of country Q's spies dispatched around the world.
